        <li><u>Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.</u> The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures.

        <li><u>No endorsement.</u> Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Other rights.</li>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.</li>
        <li>Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.</li>

      <li>You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.</li>

Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.</b></li>
      <li>The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.</li>
    </ol>
